"OpenZFS is licensed under the Common Development and Distribution License "
"(CDDL), and the Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public "
"License Version 2 (GPL-2). While both are free open source licenses they are "
"restrictive licenses. The combination of them causes problems because it "
"prevents using pieces of code exclusively available under one license with "
"pieces of code exclusively available under the other in the same binary."

"distributing both of the binaries in the same media (disk images, virtual "
