zfs-linux (0.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The SIMD acceleration has been fixed in this upstream release.
  Users could use the following two commands to double check:

    $ cat /sys/module/zfs/parameters/zfs_vdev_raidz_impl 
    $ cat /sys/module/zcommon/parameters/zfs_fletcher_4_impl

  Another notable change is the parallelization of the KABI checks
  during the configure stage, which may significantly boost the
  postinst stage of zfs-dkms that builds the kernel module.

  NEWS on the Debian packaging side:

      upstream had merged SPL source into ZFS source tree, and that
      module is now included in the zfs-dkms package.
