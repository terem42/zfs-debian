Description: OpenZFS filesystem kernel modules for Linux (kernel _KVERS_)
 An advanced integrated volume manager and filesystem that is designed for
 performance and data integrity. Snapshots, clones, checksums, deduplication,
 compression, and RAID redundancy are built-in features.
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel module for _KVERS_
 .
 Includes the SPA, DMU, ZVOL, and ZPL components of OpenZFS.

 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own zfs-modules. The zfs-source package has been
 provided for use with the Debian kernel-package utility to produce a
 version of zfs-module for your kernel.
